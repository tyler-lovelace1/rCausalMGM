Description: Scalable methods for learning causal graphical models from mixed data, including continuous, discrete, and censored variables. The package implements CausalMGM, which combines a convex, score-based approach for learning an initial moralized graph with a producer-consumer scheme that enables efficient parallel conditional independence testing in constraint-based causal discovery algorithms. The implementation supports high-dimensional datasets and provides individual access to core components of the workflow, including MGM and the PC-Stable and FCI-Stable causal discovery algorithms. To support practical applications, the package includes multiple model selection strategies, including information criteria based on likelihood and model complexity, cross-validation for out-of-sample likelihood estimation, and stability-based approaches that assess graph robustness across subsamples.
