Description: rCasualMGM is a scalable implementation of CausalMGM, a method for learning causal graphical models over mixed (continuous and discrete) data. rCausalMGM scales to high-dimensional mixed datasets by utilizing a convex score-based method for learning the initial (moralized) graph and a producer-consumer scheme that efficiently performs the conditional independence tests in constraint-based causal discovery algorithms in parallel. Each individual component of the CausalMGM procedure, such as MGM and the causal discovery algorithms PC-Stable and FCI-Stable, are also available individually. Finally, in real-world applications, model selection is essential. As such, rCausalMGM implements three approaches to model selection: (1) information criteria based on model likelihood and complexity, (2) a cross-validation approach to estimating model likelihood on out-of-sample data, and (3) stability-based approaches that assesses how stable a graphical model is across subsamples of the dataset.
