\title{Runs the causal algorithm PC50 on a dataset}
\usage{
pc50(
  df,
  initialGraph = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  threads = -1L,
  fdr = FALSE,
  rank = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE

}
\arguments{
\item{df}{The dataframe}

\item{initialGraph}{An initial undirected graph to use as a starting point. If NULL, a full graph will be used. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{alpha}{The p value below which results are considered significant. Defaults to 0.05.}

\item{threads}{The number of consumer threads to create during multi-threaded steps. If -1, defaults to number of availible processors.}

\item{fdr}{Whether or not to run with FDR correction for the adjacencies.}

\item{rank}{Whether or not to use rank-based associations as opposed to linear}

\item{verbose}{Whether or not to output additional information. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
The calculated search graph
