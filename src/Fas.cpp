/**
 * Discovers all adjacencies in data.  The procedure is to remove edges in the graph which connect pairs of
 * variables which are independent conditional on some other set of variables in the graph (the "sepset"). These are
 * removed in tiers.  First, edges which are independent conditional on zero other variables are removed, then edges
 * which are independent conditional on one other variable are removed, then two, then three, and so on, until no
 * more edges can be removed from the graph.  The edges which remain in the graph after this procedure are the
 * adjacencies in the data.
 *
 * @return a SepSet, which indicates which variables are independent conditional on which other variables
